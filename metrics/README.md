# Model Metrics

This folder contains the performance metrics for the Ozone Prediction Model.

## Files
- `metrics.json`: Contains the latest evaluation results (RMSE, R2 Score) from the test set (Year 2023).

## Interpretation
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The average error in the model's predictions (in ppb). Lower is better.
- **R2 Score**: The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Closer to 1.0 is better.
